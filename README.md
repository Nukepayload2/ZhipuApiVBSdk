# ZhipuApiVBSdk
VB-friendly .NET bindings for the ZhipuApi v4. It's part of the Nukepayload2 VB AI SDK as a model provider.

It has the same capabilities as [zhipuai-sdk-csharp-v4](https://github.com/MetaGLM/zhipuai-sdk-csharp-v4), with additional VB-friendly benefits:

- [x] No deadlock in synchronization context threads.
- [x] Enumerate result asynchronously with the syntax introduced in VB 11.
- [x] No reflection required. We support AOT compilation on .NET 8 or later.
- [x] VB flavor of API design
